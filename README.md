# About
This repository contains [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) projects that implement simple Machine Learning models. The first project implements different models for [classification](/predicting_class). The second project implements models for linear and polynomial [regression](/predicting_value).

Jupyter notebooks make it easier to read and understand `.ipynb` files by integrating cells that may contain code or markdown text and showing the output of each cell. Thanks to this appoach, you can simply read the `ipynb` file to see what  the program is doing without having to run the program in your machine. 

If you would like to clone this repository to run and edit these models, then I would recommend installing Jupyter notebook through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). My anaconda installation has Jupyter notebook version *6.0.3* with Python *3.7* as the notebook kernel. Then simply clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/EvilErick16/ML-intro.git```
